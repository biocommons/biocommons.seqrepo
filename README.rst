biocommons.seqrepo
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Python package for writing and reading a local collection of
biological sequences.  The repository is non-redundant, compressed,
and journalled, making it efficient to store and transfer multiple
snapshots.

Clients refer to sequences and metadata using familiar identifiers,
such as NM_000551.3 or GRCh38:1, or any of several hash-based
identifiers. The interface supports fast slicing of arbitrary regions
of large sequences.

A "fully-qualified" identifier includes a namespace to disambiguate
accessions (e.g., "1" in GRCh37 and GRCh38). If the namespace is
provided, seqrepo uses it as-is. If the namespace is not provided and
the unqualified identifier refers to a unique sequence, it is
returned; otherwise, ambiguous identifiers will raise an error.

SeqRepo favors identifiers from [identifiers.org](identifiers.org)
whenever available.  Examples include
[refseq](https://registry.identifiers.org/registry/refseq) and
[ensembl](https://registry.identifiers.org/registry/ensembl).

`seqrepo-rest-service
<https://github.com/biocommons/seqrepo-rest-service>`__ provides a
REST interface and docker image.

Features
!!!!!!!!

* Timestamped, read-only snapshots.
* Space-efficient storage of sequences within a single snapshot and
  across snapshots.
* Bandwidth-efficient transfer incremental updates.
* Fast fetching of sequence slices on chromosome-scale sequences.
* Precomputed digests that may be used as sequence aliases.
* Mappings of external aliases (i.e., accessions or identifiers like
  NM_013305.4) to sequences.


Deployments Scenarios
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
* Local read-only archive, mirrored from public site,
  accessed via Python API (see `Mirroring documentation <docs/mirror.rst>`__)
* Local read-write archive, maintained with command
  line utility and/or API (see `Command Line Interface documentation
  <docs/cli.rst>`__).
* Docker data-only container that may be linked to application container.
* SeqRepo and refget REST API for local or remote access (see `seqrepo-rest-service <https://github.com/biocommons/seqrepo-rest-service>`__)


Technical Quick Peek
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Within a single snapshot, sequences are stored *non-redundantly* and
*compressed* in an add-only journalled filesystem structure.  A
truncated SHA-512 hash is used to assess uniquness and as an
internal id.  (The digest is truncated for space efficiency.)

Sequences are compressed using the Block GZipped Format (`BGZF
<https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf>`__)), which enables
pysam to provide fast random access to compressed sequences. (Variable
compression typically makes random access impossible.)

Sequence files are immutable, thereby enabling the use of hardlinks
across snapshots and eliminating redundant transfers (e.g., with
rsync).

Each sequence id is associated with a namespaced alias in a sqlite
database.  Such as ``<seguid,rvvuhY0FxFLNwf10FXFIrSQ7AvQ>``,
``<NCBI,NP_004009.1>``, ``<gi,5032303>``,
``<ensembl-75ENSP00000354464>``, ``<ensembl-85,ENSP00000354464.4>``.
The sqlite database is mutable across releases.

For calibration, recent releases that include 3 human genome
assemblies (including patches), and full RefSeq sets (NM, NR, NP, NT,
XM, and XP) consumes approximately 8GB.  The minimum marginal size for
additional snapshots is approximately 2GB (for the sqlite database,
which is not hardlinked).

For more information, see `<docs/design.rst>`__.



Requirements
!!!!!!!!!!!!

Reading a sequence repository requires several Python packages, all of
which are available from pypi. Installation should be as simple as
`pip install biocommons.seqrepo`.

*Writing* sequence files also requires ``bgzip``, which provided in
the `htslib <https://github.com/samtools/htslib>`__ repo. Ubuntu users
should install the ``tabix`` package with ``sudo apt install tabix``.

Development and deployments are on Ubuntu. Other systems may work but
are not tested.  Patches to get other systems working would be
welcomed.

**Mac Developers** If you get "xcrun: error: invalid active developer
path", you need to install XCode. See this `StackOverflow answer
<https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/254380/why-am-i-getting-an-invalid-active-developer-path-when-attempting-to-use-git-a>`__.

  # Simple Pythonic interface to sequences

  >> sr["NC_000001.11"][780000:780020]
  'TGGTGGCACGCGCTTGTAGT'

  # Or, use the seqrepo shell for even easier access
  $ seqrepo start-shell -i 2018-11-26
  In [1]: sr["NC_000001.11"][780000:780020]
  Out[1]: 'TGGTGGCACGCGCTTGTAGT'
  
  # N.B. The following output is edited for simplicity
